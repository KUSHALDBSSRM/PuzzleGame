# PuzzleGame

The project involves developing a Puzzle Game android application which is primarily a simple gaming app involving solving of an image puzzle. The user/player has to capture an image which is set as the layout of the puzzle board game consisting of tiles. Provisions are provided for shuffling the tiles and then the user tries to solve by clicking and dragging the tiles to their correct locations using the blank space in order to get back the original image. A countdown timer is also present that keeps the time and there are buttons for auto solve and viewing the original image as reference. The welcome screen, apart from the play button, also consists of the four other buttons to display the credits, implement preferences, enable rating, and exit for terminating the game.
